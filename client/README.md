# CoinSwapper

CoinSwapper is a cryptocurrency exchange application, which has built in price tracking and a coin swapping feature.

You can track price movements of crypto coins through CoinGecko API and see them over 4 different time ranges.

There is also a favourites tab, which utilises MongoDB to favourite certain coins, and display them onto the favourites page.

The coin swapping feature is currently only on Arbitrum, but allows a user to swap from any token to any token on chain.
